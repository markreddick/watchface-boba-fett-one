THINKING OFF HAND THAST NORTH ARENA FONT LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE FETT FACE FONT WITHOUT THE LINES CUTOUT - MAYBE CAN CUTOUT LINES AFTER ADDING TO FACE??

HOW TO GRUNGIFY IN INKSCAPE:

- vector has to be one object
- copy a "grunge" texture into inkscape
- select both
- go to Object->Mask->Set Mask
- done


VECTOR NUMBERS:
- the ones i created
- drop shadow seems to work well to mimic the lighted edges of original
	- settings:
	- blur radius: 0.0
	- horiz offset (px): 0.1
	- vert offset (px): 0.1
	- shadow type: inner
	- blur color: 255, 255, 255, 72 (alpha)

GUNK:

- seems to work well in my quick test:
	- create little random vector using bezier tool
	- fill object with black/gray
	- filter->bumps->bubbly bumps (maybe others better?)
